        <h1>Incidents with Hashito</h1>
        <p>A lot of stuff happened with Hashito, most of it is really bad and a lot of things escalated way too much. On this page, the bigest 2 drama's about success/hashito's history are 
          shown/explained here from both sides. Most of this wasn't even his fault.

        <h1>#forgetslain</h1>
        <p>In 2015 a hypixel moderator named XxSlainMagicxX died in a skiing accident while on vacation. An ingame memorial was held a couple of days after this accident and some people started 
          spreading the #rememberslain hashtag. One of the former Success admins, Cloe, created the #forgetslain as a "joke". It spread trough a lot of platforms like twitter, discord, youtube, etc.
          At some point people got very angry about this and blamed Hashito for everything that happened because of this hashtag. A war broke out on the hypixel forums between the "#rememberslain" group 
          and Success. People got offended, hated and even mentally injured until the admins decided to temporarly ban Hashito from the forums to let it all calm down. At this point Success saw they had gone
          too far, it was never their intention to let it get to this point. What I see/saw is just a "joke" that escalated, maybe not the best timing because the hypixel community wasn't ready for jokes yet.
          After the ban, every forum post about this got cleaned up, like nothing happened. The only place where you still can find #forgetslain hashtags are on twitter.

        <h1>Guild join requirements</h1>
        <p>This incident is not one of the best known one's, but it still is one of the worse.</p>
        <p>At some point Success said in their discord: "If you want to join the guild, you need to cut "succ" in something". This was a joke again that people didn't have to take serious. It went well
          until someone sent a picture of a desk where he cut "succ" in. At this point they knew they had gone too far (again). The whole story about this kept growing and like every other story it kept changing,
          eventually the story was changed to "someone cut himself in his arm to join". People outside Success didn't know where this came from and reported this to the police department. This happened before when people claimed success
          was sending child porn in their discord, the police hasn't dont anything about it. I don't know how it went further, all I know is that this isn't over yet.

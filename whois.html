        <p style="margin-top: 20px;">Hashito is a well known Hypixel (minecraft server) player, he is best known in the minigame solo bedwars, but also on the hypixel forums as a community speaker who voice their oppinions a lot. 
            <br>Not only is he one of the best known hypixel members, he is also one of the most hated one's. More about this is explained in the <a href="incidents.html">incidents</a> page. He has a youtube channel (currently 9k subscribers) where he posts video's every day. He plays lot of bedwars challenges and is amazing at creating star level montages. 
                He can be recognized easily because his Minecraft skin is a cute little puppy a list of them can be found on the <a href="hashitoskins.html">Hashito skins</a>.

            <h1><b>The Success</b></h1>
            <p>The Success [STAR] is Hashito's hypixel guild, #66 on leaderboard, the guild's staff team is currently 2 big, 2 admins (including Hashito) and 1 moderator. The guild is known about making fun of people and it's Discord server especially because of the stuff that happened in there. It already got deleted twice because people got threatened and offended for sending childporn.
              <br>At some point one of Hashito's admins made a requirement for joining the hypixel guild, from there the hate kept growing and growing.
            <br>It is now fully recreated and there are no tracks of anything that happened in the old one's. I don't know exactly what happened then, because I wasn't a part of it yet. 
            <br>If you are already in the guild for a long time, you can recieve the "superstar" role. It means you have done a lot for the Success community.
          <br>You can suggest changements by mailing me, e-mail adress can be found on the <a href="aboutme.html">About me/contact</a> page</p> 
        </p>
        <h1>My own experience with Hashito/success</h1>
        <p>I've been around for almost 10 months now, and now look at it like it is something else. Everything I saw on the hypixel forums is NOT TRUE, maybe it was bad, but not anymore. People are friendly to each other, yes there is some hate to people outside of it,
            but the main cause of that is because they accused him of things that were never his fault. In the Discord there is some kind of hierargy, the admins are the bosses, and you listen to them, if you dont't; you get banned and you can never return. Maybe it is rude, but that are the rules.
            Hashito is a nice guy (doesn't talk a lot) haven't heard any negative words from him, he is always friendly and patient no sign of any harassment or offence. In a hypixel forum post he prommised he would change, I can say for sure he did.

        <h1>Hashito's opinions</h1>
        <h3><u>I: Respecting Opinions</u></h3>
        <p>An opinion is a view or judgment formed about something, not necessarily based on fact or knowledge. Love them or hate
          <br>them, we all have them, and everyone's opinion is all different from each other. Opinions may offend you, but we need to 
          <br>respect them. Speak about opinions respectfully, and listen to other people's opinions respectfully. That is the only way you 
          <br>will ever gain any sort of power, or influence. <u><i>Your voice is powerful.</i></u>
        </p>
        <img src="media/pictures/divide.png">
        <h3><u>II: Wrong or Right</u></h3>
        <p>How do you tell a right opinion from a wrong opinion? There are no universally wrong or right opinions, because they are, 
          <br>well, just opinions. It is very well up to you whether an opinion is wrong, or right. For example, if somebody says Hypixel is a 
          <br>bad server, I would say their opinion is wrong. However, to others, their opinion may be right. That is how it works, and we 
          <br>need to accept everyone's opinions if we are ever going to get somewhere.
        </p>
        <img src="media/pictures/divide.png">
        <h3><u>III: Opinions fuel Hypixel</u></h3>
        <p>This is a fact. Whenever we make a suggestion, an idea, a guide, we use OUR voices, OUR knowledge, OUR opinion. This 
            <br>community would never be formed if opinions didn't exist. HOW did we get these minigames? HOW did we get all this amazing 
            <br>ideas. OPINIONS, ideas from parties both agreeing and disagreeing bouncing back and forth between one another that is 
            <br>EXACTLY how great ideas are formed.

          <h1>Famous Hashito quotes</h1>
          <h3><i>"I think we are meaningless so it's funny when we are too "scared" to do something to get embarrassed. 
            <br>Like nobody really cares about you that much. You need to fail to succeed. I have that problem too,
            <br>but I realize the grand scheme of things"</i> - Hashito</h3>
          <h3><i>"If you want to live meaningless life and go to your job where you are just used and come home every night
            <br>to enjoy your little one week vacation until you back slaving away, and then retire and die and nobody remembers
            <br>you then sure. Although for me I think life is too short to do that so school only hinders anything I'd want to do.
            <br>Slaving away for 8 hours in a facility where you learn nothing that could be spent doing something and building something
            <br>for yourself. You don't need school to have a "job" or be successful"</i> - Hashito</h3>
          <h3><i>"Yeah, I get it school is important for getting you into a "job". However, most of us hinder our potential
            <br>of something <b>WE</b> can achieve <b>OURSELVES</b> by spending 8+ hours a day 5 day's a week 
            <br>learning what <b>THEY</b> want us to learn. What is we spent that time innovating or creating something?
            <br>We have so many resources at our finger tips than ever before."
          </i> - Hashito</h3>
          <h3><i>"Using your intelligence to do dumb things and appeal to the most common denominator can make you more successful
            <br>that using it for so called "intelligent" things"</i> - Hashito</h3>   
          <h3><i>"It doesn't matter if others don't believe in you as long as you believe in yourself"</i> - Hashito</h3>   
          
          <h3><i>"If you have trouble falling asleep it means you didn't work hard enough during the day"</i> - Hashito</h3>
          <h3><i>"You are not defined by any labels until you accept it yourself"</i> - Hashito</h3>
          <h3><i>"You can never escape sleep. Sleep will always win."</i> - Hashito</h3>
          <h3><i>"Vision is easy; Execution is hard."</i> - Hashito</h3>
          <h3><i>"We dwell on the doors that have closed behind us that we fail to see the doors that are opening in front of us."</i> - Hashito</h3>
